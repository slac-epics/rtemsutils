<h1>Adding the spy command to an RTEMS/EPICS application</h1>

<p>Several files need minor modifications to add the spy command to an
application.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add the full path to the RTEMS utilities support directory to the
    application <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file:<br />
    <tt>RTEMS_UTILS=</tt><em>xxxx</em><tt>/modules/soft/rtemsutils-&lt;release&gt;</tt><br
    />
    Where <tt>&lt;release&gt;</tt> is the release number of of the RTEMS
    utility support.</li>
  <li>Add spy support to application database definition file<br />
    The application database definition file must include the database
    definition files for the spy support. There are two ways that this can be
    done:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are building your application database definition file from
        an <em>xxx</em><tt>Include.dbd</tt> file you include the additional
        database definition file in that file:<br />
        <tt>include "base.dbd"</tt><br />
        <tt>include "spy.dbd"</tt><br />
      </li>
      <li>If you are building your application database definition file from
        the application Makefile you specify the aditional database
        definition file there:<br />
        <em>xxx</em><tt>_DBD += base.dbd</tt><br />
        <em>xxx</em><tt>_DBD += spy.dbd</tt><br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the RTEMS utility support libraries to the application<br />
    You must link the RTEMS utility support library with the application. Add
    the following line: <br />
    <em>xxx</em><tt>_LIBS += rtemsutils</tt><br />
    before the <br />
    <em>xxx</em><tt>_LIBS += $(EPICS_BASE_IOC_LIBS)</tt><br />
    in the application Makefile.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the task priority column is the RTEMS priority, not the EPICS
priority, of the task. 
<h1>Installation and Building</h1>
After obtaining a copy of the distribution, it must be installed and built
for use at your site. <ol>
  <li>Place the distribution file into the <tt>modules/soft</tt> directory.</li>
  <li>Execute the following commands:<br />
    <tt>cd modules/soft</tt><br />
    <tt>gunzip rtemsutils-&lt;release&gt;.tar.gz</tt><br />
    <tt>tar xf rtemsutils-&lt;release&gt;.tar</tt><br />
    <tt>cd rtemsutils-&lt;release&gt;</tt><br />
    Where <tt>&lt;release&gt;</tt> is the release number of of the RTEMS
    utility support.</li>
  <li>Edit the <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file and set the path to your
    installation of EPICS base.</li>
  <li>Execute <tt>make</tt> in the top level directory.</li>
</ol>
